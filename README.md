An open-source app designed to help anyone dealing with plants at *any* scale.

Through research, I have found that there are a few apps out there, some paid and some free, that track plants.  The concept of tracking plants with code is not new, but it appears that each of these apps are very specific and unscalable.  My goal is to make an app that anyone can download and use to track their plants.  Indoor and outdoor.  Expected vs. actual.
